# Argon Electronics

![Argon Electronics on desktop and phone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selldone-custom-layouts/official-argon/main/docs/screenshots/cover.jpg)

**Argon Electronics** is a custom storefront **Layout** for Selldone shops: a single-shop electronics store dressed as a bright, busy, friendly catalogue retailer. A red logo tile and a wide search; a category carousel of packshot tiles; dark promo cards and offer pills; a green deal strip with the deals' real end date; photo cards, rails and trending tags; green Add to basket buttons on every card; a results page with a row of filter dropdowns; a two-column product page with stacked buy cards; a side-by-side compare page; a receipt-first cart and a desk-style account.

It runs on **[argon.selldone.shop](https://argon.selldone.shop)**, one address of the Selldone shop Digini: one shop, one Layout per domain (see [Go Live](Go-Live)). It is built on the official [selldone/storefront](https://github.com/selldone/storefront), so Selldone's cart, checkout, payments and orders keep working underneath a new design.

## How a Selldone Layout works (one minute)

1. A **Layout** is a complete storefront app (Vue 3) that runs on Selldone's own servers instead of the default storefront.
2. You build it, zip it, and **upload** it to your Selldone developer account with the official [selldone-cli](https://github.com/selldone/cli). Each upload is a new **version**.
3. You **attach** a version to your shop, or to one domain of it.
4. Selldone injects **your** shop into the Layout: its products, categories, prices, tags, languages and settings. Nothing about Digini is hard-coded: only the brand name (one line) and the photos (category photos matched by slug, and named photo slots).

## The look

| Part | Argon |
| --- | --- |
| Brand colour | red `#c8102e`: the logo tile, links, accents, the deal badge |
| Buy colour | green `#007a3d`: every Add to basket, Checkout and chosen state |
| Quick links | near-black `#1a1a1a` pills |
| Grounds | a white page, light-grey `#f2f2f2` sections |
| Type and icons | Barlow, Material Symbols Rounded |
| Buttons | flat; hover changes the colour only; no line under any word or icon; selection rings inside the box |
| Theme | five palettes, a custom colour and Light / Dark; a visitor switcher on Argon's showcase shop only (see [Theme and colours](Theme-and-colours)) |
