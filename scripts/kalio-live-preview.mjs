/*
 * Kalio — live preview of an uploaded Layout release.
 *
 * Serves the shop's real storefront HTML, fetched from Selldone on each
 * request, with one change: Selldone's layout loader (window.sdShopLayout)
 * is pointed at the release you name instead of the one the shop has
 * selected. Everything else — shop, theme, metas, the loader itself and its
 * redirect from selldone.com/cdn-storage-public to cdn.selldone.com — is
 * Selldone's own, so this is exactly what visitors will get once that
 * release is selected for the shop.
 *
 * Usage: node --use-system-ca scripts/kalio-live-preview.mjs <release-id> [port]
 *   <release-id> is the ULID in the deploy path layouts/23/releases/<ULID>/app
 *   (GET /developer/layouts/23/deploys). Without it the shop's own selection
 *   is served unchanged.
 *   http://localhost:<port>/            the shop as configured
 *   http://localhost:<port>/?home=shop  with Home set to the shop page
 *                                       (remembered in a cookie)
