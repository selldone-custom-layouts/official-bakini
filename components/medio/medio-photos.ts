/*
 * Medio — the photo slots (the one registry).
 *
 * Every lifestyle photo slot on Medio's pages that is not a category's own
 * photo (those are assets/medio/<shape>-<category slug>.webp, see medio.ts
 * photoOf) is listed here: slot → file name, its size and where it shows.
 *
 * A slot uses assets/photos/<file> when that file exists at build time
 * (import.meta.glob lists only the files that are there). Until then it
 * draws a calm placeholder of the same shape with the file's name in it, so
 * the page still looks intentional and the owner can see which file goes
 * where. To add the photos: put the WebP files in assets/photos/, build and
 * release. No code change. The prompts that make them are in
 * digini-design/codex-photos-medio.md.
 *
 * Two kinds of slot follow the shop's live data and so take a name part:
 *  - trend-<tag>.webp: one per product tag in "Trending now" (wireless,
 *    portable, 4k, gaming today; a new tag looks for its own file);
 *  - brand-<brand>.webp: one per brand in "Explore our brands" (the four
 *    brands with the most products).
