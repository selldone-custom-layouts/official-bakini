/*
 * Kalio — the sample texts of the shop's own pages (5 November 2026).
 *
 * About us, Terms of use and Privacy come from the shop's profiles in the
 * Selldone dashboard. molino has written none of them yet, and the owner
 * asked for full pages in the meantime, filled with general text that says
 * it is a test and not real. These are those texts; each page shows them,
 * under KalioSampleNote, only while the shop's own profile is missing.
 *
 * Nothing here is a promise: the terms do not form an agreement and the
 * policy is not the shop's policy. Dates, numbers and names in the letter
 * are marked as examples.
