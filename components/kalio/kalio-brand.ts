/* ━━━━━━━━━━━━ The Layout's own name and logo ━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Medio Electronics runs on its own address of the shop Digini (one shop, a
   Layout per domain), so the shop's own title would put "Digini" in its
   header, footer, page titles and every line that names the shop. Like Tario
   and Walio, the title is replaced here, as soon as the shop is read, for
   this Layout only. The shop record on Selldone (its emails, dashboard, the
   SEO page Selldone serves to crawlers) keeps its own title.

   THE BRAND IS THIS ONE LINE: `name`. The wordmark (components/medio/
   MedioLogo.vue) is drawn from it in lower case, white on a red rounded
   tile. Set `name: null` to keep the shop's own title.

   The mark (assets/brand/medio-mark.svg, 64x64 SVG: a white "a" on the red
   tile) is the browser tab's icon and the avatar on order messages. */
